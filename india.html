<h1>10 Topics About India</h1>

<h2 onclick="toggleContent('topic1')">1. Geography and Climate of India</h2>
<div id="topic1" class="content">
  <p>
    India is the seventh-largest country in the world by land area, spanning over 3.2 million square kilometers. Its diverse geography ranges from the towering Himalayan peaks in the north to the vast Thar Desert in the west and tropical rainforests in the northeast and southwest. India is bordered by the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, and Bay of Bengal. The country's climate varies widely: the northern Himalayas are cold with heavy snowfall, while the southern regions experience tropical weather. The country has four primary seasons – summer, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter – which shape agricultural cycles and daily lives. The monsoon season, from June to September, is particularly crucial because it provides the majority of the annual rainfall, supporting India's predominantly agrarian economy. Rivers such as the Ganges, Yamuna, and Brahmaputra play a vital role in irrigation, drinking water, and religious practices. Despite its vast size, India's landscape also includes fertile plains, plateaus, and coastal regions, all contributing to its ecological diversity.
